# Lunch App

I tried to put this app on a real kubernetes cluster, but it didn't work... I'm sad. I spent many many hours trying doing that.
Maybe it was because the documentation that I looked at, it was out of date.
Anyway.

Here's a video of the app using my local kubernetes cluster with the production docker images on it.
