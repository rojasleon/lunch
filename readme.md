# Lunch App

I tried to put this app on a real kubernetes cluster, but it didn't work... I'm sad. I spent many many hours trying doing that.
Maybe it was because the documentation that I looked at, it was out of date.

It it was it is...

I'd like to improve the ingredients and purchases pages to improve the queries (see video)
But the time is over...

Here's a video of the app using my local kubernetes cluster with the production docker images on it.
